<h1>Love knowing the temperature outside? Hate getting that information instantly? Try Not-That-Temp now!</h1>
<h2>In the first search bar enter your suburb, town, city, country or postcode. Optionally, specify your country in the second search bar before hitting 'Search' to find out what the temperature at that location isn't (between -55 and 55 degrees). Next hit 'New Temp' to get another figure which is not the temperature at that location. Repeat this process to determine the current temperature at any location in the world. Who thought getting the weather could be so fun?!</h2>
