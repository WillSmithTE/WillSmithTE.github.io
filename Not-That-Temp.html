<h2>In the first search bar enter your postcode, suburb, town, city or country. Optionally, also specify your country in the second search bar. To find out what the temperature isn't in that location, hit 'Search'; if that's not enough for you, keep hitting 'New Temp' to get more and more temperatures which do not describe the current climate in the chosen location.  Next hit 'New Temp' to get another figure which is not the temperature at that location. Who thought getting the weather could be so fun?!</h2>
